# Code Along with Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition

This repository has the sole purpose of learning the Python programming language while coding along with the book Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, by Eric Matthes. It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## Project no. 1: Alien Invasion - Making a game with Python

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from the 2nd part of Python Crash Course: Projects. 

## General gameplay description 

"In Alien Invasion the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left moving the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends (source: Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, pg. 228)."

## Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#project-setup) for dependency management and packaging.

An example on how to use Poetry can be found at [Managing Projects with Poetry](https://medium.com/@sjalexandre/python-tutorial-managing-projects-with-poetry-cd2deab72697).
