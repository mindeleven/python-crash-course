# Code Along with Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition

This repository has the sole purpose of learning the Python programming language while coding along with the book Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, by Eric Matthes. It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## Project no. 1: Alien Invasion - Making a game with Python

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from the 2nd part of Python Crash Course: Projects. 

## Chapter 12: A ship that fires bullets

The goal of this part of the project is to create a rocket ship, that moves right and left and fires bullets in response to player input.
