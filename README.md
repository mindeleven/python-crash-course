# Code Along with Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition

This repository has the sole purpose of learning the Python programming language while coding along with the book Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition, by Eric Matthes. It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## A hands-on, project-based introduction to programming

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition.
